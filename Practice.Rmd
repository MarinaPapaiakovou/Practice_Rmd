# Practice with R Markdown
## Compensation data 

Importing data now into R 
Compensation data 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Comp <- read.csv("compensation.csv")
head(Comp)
```

## Including Plots

Adding a plot, Root ~ fruit coloured by Grazing 

```{r}
ggplot(Comp, aes (x= Root, y= Fruit, colour = Grazing))+
geom_point()

```

```{r}
ggplot (Comp, aes(x = Root, y = Fruit, colour = Grazing))+
facet_wrap(~ Grazing)+
geom_boxplot()
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
